# python version project test

### Details

In Python 3.10, one of the notable additions to the standard library is the `str.removeprefix()` and `str.removesuffix()` string methods.
These methods provide a straightforward way to remove a prefix or suffix from a string, respectively, if it exists.
Prior to Python 3.10, achieving similar functionality required more verbose code or custom utility functions.
The code is main.py will work in Python 3.10 but not in Python 3.8.

Using a compatible python version, just run

```shell
pip install -e .
mycommand
```
