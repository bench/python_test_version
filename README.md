# python version project test

**Compatibility: 3.8 or newer**

### Details

One of the changes in the standard library that came with Python 3.8 is the introduction of the `math.prod()` function.

This function calculates the product of all the items in an iterable, such as a list.

This function is not available in Python 3.6, making it a good example of code that is compatible with Python 3.8 but not with Python 3.6.


### How to

Using a compatible python version, just run

```shell
pip install -e .
mycommand
```
